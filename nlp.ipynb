    "* On the second pass if any contractions are present with multiple rules we proceed to replace all combinations of rules to produce all possible texts. \n",
    "* Each text is then passed through a grammar checker and the Word Moverâ€™s Distance (WMD) is calculated between it and the original text. The hypotheses are then sorted by least number of grammatical errors and shortest distance from the original text and the top hypothesis is returned as the expanded form."
